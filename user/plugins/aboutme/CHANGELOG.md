# v1.1.0

1. [](#improved)
    * Changed the social pages feature. You can now pick a different font icon from font-awesome, change the order the links will appear in, and also change the title which will appear when the icon is hovered. You might want to change your own `aboutme.yaml` in your user config with the new `aboutme.yaml` so the plugin does not break
2. [](#bugfix)
	* The source of the avatar was broken when used with multi-languages. It's now fixed
